# Deep Research Agent Prompt

## Objective
Research best practices, idioms, and examples relevant to this section.
Draw exclusively from **verified authoritative sources** (official Zig docs, Zig GitHub projects, community threads).

## Guardrails
- Every factual claim **must** include a markdown footnote with URL.
- Prefer examples from `TigerBeetle`, `Ghostty`, `Bun`, `Mach`, and Zig stdlib.
- Distinguish Zig version differences clearly.
- Use concise, neutral technical prose — avoid speculation.
- Structure findings into "Patterns", "Anti-patterns", and "Examples".

## Output Format
1. **Summary Table** — concise overview of best practices.
2. **Detailed Explanation** — prose with code samples.
3. **References** — explicit list of URLs.
