**Who This Guide Is For:**
- Systems programmers learning Zig from C, C++, or Rust backgrounds
- Developers building Zig applications with modern Zig
- Teams evaluating Zig for production use
- Contributors to Zig open-source projects

**This guide assumes:**
- Prior systems programming experience
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts
- Understanding of memory management principles
