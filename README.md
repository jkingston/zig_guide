# Zig Developer Guide — Workspace Scaffold

This repository hosts the in-progress **Zig Developer Guide** focused on idioms and best practices across Zig 0.14.1 → 0.15.2.

See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for version support policy and update workflow.

Each section is isolated for deep-research agent work. Agents must:
- Cite *only authoritative or clearly identified community sources.*
- Include all URLs directly in Markdown footnotes.
- Produce neutral, concise, example-driven prose.
- Use `✅ 0.15` and `🕐 0.14` to indicate version-specific content.

The `/sections` directory contains structured folders per chapter.
